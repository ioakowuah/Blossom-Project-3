# Blossom-Project-3
In this Capstone Project we build a Machine Learning model that will help the owner of a company to detect features which will help him 
decide on employee promotion. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier and 
Xgboost Classifier were developed. Next Maximum Hard Voting Emsemble is used to provide an optimal model.
